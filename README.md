# CookieRunSpriteTester

**USE >>>** https://hehe1696.github.io/CookieRunSpriteTester/

Open and test Cookie Run sprites and frames, mainly for testing personal sprite mods.

Input a .zip file filled with all of the individual, split-up sprites for the software to work properly.

Please note the program is designed around GingerBrave and should work correctly for OvenBreak 2 cookies, if some animations do not work properly, this may be why.
HOWEVER: Most should still work properly, things like the "Damage" sprites may show incorrectly which is not too large of an issue.
